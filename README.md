ORGANIZE STATE STRUCTURE BASED ON DATA TYPES, NOT COMPONENTS

Root state slices should be defined and named based on the major data types or areas of functionality in your application, not based on which specific components you have in your UI. This is because there is not a strict 1:1 correlation between data in the Redux store and components in the UI, and many components may need to access the same data. Think of the state tree as a sort of global database that any part of the app can access to read just the pieces of state needed in that component.

For example, a blogging app might need to track who is logged in, information on authors and posts, and perhaps some info on what screen is active. A good state structure might look like {auth, posts, users, ui}. A bad structure would be something like {loginScreen, usersList, postsList}.




STRUCTURE YOUR COMPONENTS BY THE PAGES THEY WERE USED IN FIRST
YOU CAN PUT TRULY REUSABLE COMPONENTS LIKE BUTTONS ON A REUSABLE FOLDER

STRUCTURE YOUR REDUX BY THE (COMPONENTNAME/REUSABLESTATE I.E AUTH)(SLICE.JS) 
AND PUT THE REDUCERS ACTION-CREATORS & ACTION-NAMES THERE
AND PUT YOUR ROOT-REDUCER, SELECTORS, & STORE-CONFIG IN THEIR OWN FILE

YOUR SELECTOR FILE WILL CONTAIN ALL SELECTORS FOR ALL YOUR REDUX STATES

HAVE A PAGES FOLDER WHERE ALL YOUR PAGES ARE 
YOUR PAGES SHOULD NOT CONTAIN CODE OR CODE LOGIC IT SHOULD ONLY CONTAIN 
COMPONENTS & RENDERING LOGIC JUST LIKE YOUR APP.JS DOES

HAVE A HELPER.JS FILE FOR YOUR REUSABLE FUNCTIONS

HAVE A FIREBASE FOLDER TO PUT ALL YOUR FIREBASE CODE

HAVE A CONFIG FOLDER TO STORE THINGS LIKE API BASE URLS OR LOCAL STORAGE KEYS

DO ALL YOUR WRAPPING I.E PROVIDER FROM REDUX OR BROWSER ROUTER FROM REACT 
ROUTER DOM INSIDE YOUR INDEX.JS

HAVE A CSS FOLDER AND PUT YOUR PAGES STYLES IN SEPARATE FILES (PARTIALS) 
YOU CAN ALSO PUT TRULY REUSABLE COMPONENT STYLES IN THEIR OWN FILE 

(THESE RULES ARE NOT PERFECT AND CAN CHANGE ANYTIME AS I LEARN MORE)

SELECTORS NAMING FORMAT == >> GET SLICENAME INITIALSTATEKEY

<!-- NOTES -->
IN YOUR REDUX STATE FILE FOR DIFF COMPONENTS / REUSABLE STATES, 
THE INITIAL STATE IS USUALLY AN OBJECT AND THAT IS A DISADVANTAGE
AND A REASON TO USE THE RESELECT LIBRARY FOR MOMOIZATION CUS IF 
YOU PERFORM AN ACTION, SINCE THE STATE IS IMMUATABLE YOU WILL HAVE 
TO PROVIDE A NEW STATE OBJECT AND THAT WILL CAUSE A RE RENDER TO ANY 
COMPONENT USING PARTS OF THE CART STATE. BUT IF YOU USED A SELECTOR 
TO SELECT A PART OF A STATE AND THE INITIAL STATE CHANGES, THE SELECTOR
WILL COMPUTE THE VALUE OF THE PORTION OF THE STATE YOU ARE SELECTING 
AND IF IT DID NOT CHANGE IT WILL NOT CHANGE ITS VALUE TO AVOID CAUSING
A RERENDER IN YOUR COMPONENT.
